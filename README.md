Current file structure for the project is as follows :
```
> Project Folder
    app.py
    > templates
        layout.html
        chat_room.html
    > static
        js
        chat_room.js
    > css
        style.css
        chat_room.css
```
app.py is the main flask application module and should be in the root of your project folder.
