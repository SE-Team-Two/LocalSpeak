# SpeakEasy

A location based chat web app developed in python and flask for our software engineering class.

Users can create accounts, create geolocation based chat rooms, join nearby chatrooms, and participate in a global chat in which users can filter the message they recieve based on how far away from them they were sent. 

# Deploying

To run SpeakEasy for yourself, follow the instructions in DEPLOYING.md. SpeakyEasy has previously been successfully deployed to pythonanywhere. 

# Testing

The app has been tested with behaviour and unit tests which are located in the test folder.
